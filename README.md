# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

-The main motivation behind this project is to make more people aware of coding and how important it is around us. 
-This project was built to provide important information about coding.
-With the information listed in this project, people can draw on the information to help solve problems that may exist in coding. 
-I've learnt through this project that I'm capable of learning new things that seemed so far from my grasp before. Coding is all around us and being part of it can lead to great things in the future. 

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation "N/A"

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
Each section contains notes on a particular topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.


## Credits “N/A”

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
